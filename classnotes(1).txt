Good Morning :))

Program ? - set of instructions to OS/CPU

Software ? - set of programs to solve user problems

System Software - s/w that manages the system
EX - compilers, interpreters, device drivers, loaders, linkers, operating system

Application Software - s/w that solves user problems.
Ex - notepad , MS OFFICE, VSCODE ,browsers, calc, media players , games, add.c .....
Define OS
OS = is a system software. It acts as an interface between  
	a. system and end user (GUI , CLI)
	b. system and program user ( system calls)

OS manages the system as follows-
a. process management
b. memory management
c. file management
d. security

what is a system ?  Hardware 

	I have a file ex1.c can we run this? NO
	ex1.c --compiler-->  ex1.exe
	
	Where is the ex1.exe stored ? Hard Disk
	BIT = BInary digiT
	What is the structure of HDD ?
	Is is a volatile or non volatile storage ?
		non volatile storage 
	non volatile = data is preserved even after power off.
	Size -  >= 1 TB
	
	1 bit
	8 bits = 1 byte
	8 * 1024 bits = 1 kbytes
	8 * 1024 * 1000 = 1mbytes
	8 * 1024 *1000 *1000 = 1gbytes
	8 * 1024 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bits
	 = 1 terra bytes
	 
	access TIme is SLOW   = ranges into ms 
	
	   1 sec
	   10 raised to -3 sec = 1/1000 sec = 1ms 
10 raised  to  -6 sec 1/1000000 sec  = 1 micro sec
10 raisd to -9 sec 1/1000000000 sec = 1 nano sec	

__________________
SSD  = solid state device = semiconductor storage
	no moving parts = access is faster than HDD
______________________________   
	
Ex1.exe (HDD) ------(loader)--------->RAM
	
RAM = volatile storage 
RAM will store data in  ???? transistors and capacitors 
size bet 1 GB  to 16GB

access time is faster than HDD = ranges in micro sec
_____________________________________

program may be transferred to caches  also

cache memory =  L2 cache , L1 cache 
semiconductor memory fast access 
L2 size > 1 MB
L1 size > 32 KB
___________________________________________

From the L1 cache ---Data Bus----->CPU Registers


CPU registers are fast access small storage
size - depends on the WORD SIZE 

32 bit = 4 bytes
64 bit = 8 bytes

Registers type =  
IR = instruction register = store the instruction 
PC = Program counter = stores the address of next instruction
DR0 =  data register 0  
DR1 = data register 1
ADR0 = MAR0 
ADR1 = MAR1
Accumulator = accumulates the output of the ALU

__________________________

Who executes the instructions ? 
	ALU = Arithmetic Logic Unit = to execute instructions using electronic circuits 
	
	Which instructions can be executed by the ALU?
	   CPU instructions
		1. A = + - / * %
		2. L = && || !
		3. R =  < >  <=  >= != ==
________________________________________

  add.c 
	   printf enter 2 nums  } IO instruction
	   scanf  %d %d &a , &b } IO instruction
	   sum = a+b } CPU instruction
	   printf sum } IO instruction

__________________
IO instructions are executed by the 
IO PROCESSOR / IO COPROCESSOR /DMA

DMA = direct memory access = transfer data directly between memory and IO devices not including CPU

IO Devices = 
	Input device = sends Input to RAM
Ex = KBD , mouse , mic , scanner, joystick, touchscreen, MICR , bar code reader , card reader , camera , thumb retina scanner , MRI scanner 
sensors 

	Output device = sends variables in RAM to external user
	monitor, printer, speaker , projector , plotter

What is the definition of OS?
What is the system ?
____________________________________________
Different types of operating systems -
	1. GPOS = general purpose OS
		windows 11, linux distro 
		
	2. Multiuser OS = many users can login at a time 
			ubuntu , CentOS 
			
	3. Single User OS = at a time only one user can login
			Windows 11
	
	4. Embedded OS = to manage embedded circuits in machines
	5. Distributed OS = For distributed applications on a network
	6. Network OS 
	7. RTOS = real time OS = dead line based OS 
	8. mobile OS 

GOOGLE examples of each type !!!

Network protocols to communicate between client and server
	- telnet through putty 
protocol = decides what will be the request and response format 
	ex - telnet 
		 to transfer files = ftp , sftp 
		 to connect through urls http, https

IP address = unique address or ID of a machine in a LAN 

Server IP : 192.168.100.155
_______

_____________________________________
In the lab ---
	1. open your windows
	2. open the putty 
		  enter IP address
		  change color and font size
	3. open the terminal to centOS server 
	4. tty = Terminal TYpe
	5. observe the prompt = note that this is the CLI 
	6. enter a few times - observe the prompt 
	7. enter a command  "clear"

__________________________________________

Linux  DISTRO  = Linux Distribution =
	using core kernel of linux many flavors / DISTRO are created
	  For ex ---  Red hat , ubuntu , centOS , Kali , Debian, Suse
			mandrake, fedora , arch linux , mandriva , mint 
			BOSS 
			
	Open Source  = source code is available on GIT
					programmers can modify it 
					
	GNU public license = free to use 
	
Windows 
		- Proprietory = source code is not available 
		- Licensed = purchase 

_________________________________________

SHELL  = CLI program 
	default SHELL in linux  =  bash
	we may have many shells in Linux DISTRO  = ksh, csh , tcsh
	bourne shell , .....
	every shell understands different commands !!!

File Handling Bash commands ----------
	Linux file system  top most folder is a SINGLE folder 
		 /    = forward slash 
		 
	cd = change folders 
	pwd = present working directory = /home/group001

		/   = top folder 
		 ---- home    = parent folder
		         -------group001  = current folder

	  current folder  =  . (dot)
	  parent folder =  . .  (dot dot )
	go to parent folder = cd .. 
	cd /
	cd ./home
	cd ./group001
	cd ~   ( ~ = means the login folder of the current user )
	ls
