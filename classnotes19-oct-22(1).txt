Good Morning :))

Signals = interrupt that one process can send to another process . 
-this is a Linux DISTRO feature 
- signal is a integer 
- the signals are processed by the signal handler 
   -there are inbuilt signal handlers
   -we can also provide signal handlers
- to see the signal info  man -7 signal
- The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored  - NON MASKABLE 

- to provide our own handler we have to use a system call signal()

- on prompt we can send signals to the process using kill command
- from c code if want to send signals then we use a system call  kill()

- ctrl-c sends a signal of SIGINT to the process

Process = program in execution

	what is the sequence of process execution?
		main() { ..............}

Thread = it is the sequence of process execution 
		 it is the path of execution of a process

Default thread that EVERY c process MUST have = MAIN THREAD  !!!

Can we have more threads other than main in a PROCESS?
YES 
that process is called as Multithreaded process

Why we may need more threads in a process ?
 - for simultaneous execution of TASKS in a process
 
Examples--
   process ---------threads
	Zoom            chat,audio,video, screen sharing
	meet
	teams
	
	game ---------- player1 , player2, animation, score,
					timer
					
	word            editor , spellchecker, auto save
	mediaplayer ----audio , edit playlist 
	IDE --------   editor , compiler , assistant 
	
Difference between Process and Thread 
- thread is a part of the process
-process creation - PCB(pid), process address space ( code, data , stack , heap) is loaded in RAM
 thread creation --- TCB(tid) , thread shares the code data and heap with other threads , BUT the stack is newly created for each thread , every thread has exclusive stack

- remaining lifecycle - ready , running, wait, terminate is same for process and thread 
	
How can we create more threads other than main in C on Linux DISTRO ?
use pthread library !!!
it is a POSIX thread library of Linux 

___________________________________________
 exec family of system calls 
		- to run linux command from c program 

fork = creates a copy of current process image 
	  different PIDs
		pid of parent ( current )
		pid of child ( new )

exec = replaces current process image with new process image 
		same PID ( for current and new )

---p means find command from path environment variable
--- l  means parameters are given as list
  execl
  execlp 
 
----v means parameters are given as array 
  execv
  execvp

Redirection ---- output has to be sent to a file instead of console 
	>  output will overwrite the contents of file
	>> output will append to the contents of file 

SEE OVERWRITING
ls > myfile
ps > myfile 

SEE APPEND
ls >> myfile
ps >> myfile
